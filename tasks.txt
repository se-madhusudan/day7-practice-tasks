---------------------------------------------------------------------
//////////////////////////// Tasks \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a simple to-do list where the user can add and remove items.

2. Implement a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. Create a form with input fields for a user's name and email. Validate that both fields are filled out and that the email address is in a valid format before allowing the form to be submitted

4. Create an image slider that automatically changes images every 3 seconds. Add next and previous buttons to manually change the images.

5. Create a countdown timer that counts down from a specified number of seconds and displays the remaining time. When the timer reaches zero, display "Time's up!".
